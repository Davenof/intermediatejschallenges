 <p>CHALLENGES</p>
 <ol>
    <li>
       <h3>reverseArray()</h3>
       <p>
         Write a function, <code>reverseArray()</code>, that takes in an array as an argument and returns a new array with the elements in the reverse order.
         <br><br>
         There’s a built-in method that does a lot of this work for you, but here you’re not allowed to use it.
       </p>

       <h3>greetAliens()</h3>
         Write a function, <code>greetAliens()</code>, that takes in an array of strings and uses a <code>for</code> loop to print a greeting with each  string in the array. You are not allowed to use <code>.forEach()</code>.
       <br><br>
         The greeting should take the following format: <br><br>
         <em>“Oh powerful <code>[stringElement]</code>, we humans offer our unconditional surrender!”</em>
     <p> &nbsp; </p>
    </li>
<li>
       <h3>convertToBaby()</h3>
       <p>
        Write a function, <code>convertToBaby()</code>, that takes in an array as an argument and, using a loop, returns a new array with each string in the array prepended with <code>'baby '</code>. You are not allowed to use <code>map</code>.
       </p>
 <p> &nbsp; </p>
    </li>
    <li>
       <h3>smallestPowerOfTwo()</h3>
         Write a function, <code>smallestPowerOfTwo()</code>, which takes in an array. Within the function, create a new array called <code>results</code>. Then, loop through the argument array and calculate the smallest power of two which is greater than or equal to the current element before using <code>.push()</code> to add it to results. It should print the returned array in the format: 
     <br><br>
     [ 8, 4, 16, 32 ]
     <p> &nbsp; </p>
    </li>
    <li>
       <h3>declineEverything() and acceptEverything()</h3>
       <p>
         Write a function <code>declineEverything()</code> that takes in an array of strings and, using <code>.forEach()</code>, loops through each element in the array and calls <code>politelyDecline()</code> with each of them.
<br><br>
The <code>.forEach()</code> function should apply <code>politelyDecline()</code> directly; it should NOT merely receive an argument function that uses <code>politelyDecline()</code>.
<br><br>
You can test your function by passing in the <code>veggies</code> array or by making your own array!
  <br><br>
        Write another function <code>acceptEverything()</code> that takes in an array of strings and loops through each element in the array and grudgingly accepts each of them, by logging to the console in the following format: <br><br>
        <em>'Ok, I guess I will eat some [element].'</em>
<br><br>
You can use any technique you want to accomplish this task. You can test your function when you’re ready by passing in the <code>veggies</code> array or by making your own array!

       <h3>squareNums()</h3>
         Write a function, <code>squareNums()</code>, that takes in an array of numbers and, using <code>.map()</code>, returns an array with the square of each of the elements of that array.
<br><br>
You can test your function by passing in the <code>numbers</code> array or by making your own array!

<li>
       <h3>shoutGreetings()</h3>
       <p>
        Write a function <code>shoutGreetings()</code> that takes in an array of strings and returns a new array. This new array should contain all the strings from the argument array but with capitalized letters and an exclamation point appended to the end: <code>'heya'</code> will become <code>'HEYA!'</code>.
<br><br>
You can use any technique you want to accomplish this task.
<br><br>
You can test your function by passing in the <code>greetings</code> array or by making your own array!

    <li>
       <h3>sortYears()</h3>
         Write a function <code>sortYears()</code> that takes in an array of years, and, using the built-in <code>.sort()</code> method, returns that array with the years sorted in descending order.
<br><br>
You can test your function by passing in the <code>years</code> array or by making your own array of years!
     <p> &nbsp; </p>
    </li>
    <h3>justCoolStuff()</h3>
       <p>
        Write a function <code>justCoolStuff()</code> that takes in two arrays of strings, and, using the built-in <code>.filter()</code> method, returns an array with the items that are present in both arrays.
<br><br>
You can test your function by passing in the <code>myStuff</code> and <code>coolStuff</code> arrays or by making arrays of your own!

       <h3>isTheDinnerVegan()</h3>
         Write a function <code>isTheDinnerVegan()</code> that takes in an array of food objects in the format:
<br><br>
 {name: 'cabbage', source: 'plant' }
 <br><br>
and returns a boolean value based on whether or not every item in the array has entirely plant-based origins.
